# Marketing Analytics

I conducted an in-depth analysis on grocery delivery company customer data to address key questions from the CFO regarding customer segments and customer acquisition. I utilized a dataset to provide insights and strategic recommendations. 

- Analyzed customer loyalty segments and identified the customer group generating the highest sales in a 12-month period.
- Quantified the sales generated by the identified customer group and determined the growth opportunity per person within the segment.
- Examined customer acquisition from 2012 to 2017, identified the geographies where most customers were acquired, and calculated their representation as a percentage of overall customer acquisition.
- Determined the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of customer acquisition in the identified geographies for the period 2014-2017.
- Evaluated the trend of customer acquisition based on the CAGR, assessed its impact on sales growth, and provided an explanation.
